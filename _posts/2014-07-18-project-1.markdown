description: My first experience working in 3D space can be traced back to the numerous hours using valve's <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor">Hammer Editor</a> to create <a href="https://blog.counter-strike.net/"> Counter Strike Global Offensive</a> custom maps. Although many of the maps went unfinished, it was a great time and I learned alot about how to work in 3d environments, and most importantly how to optimize, due to how old the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)"> Source Engine</a> really is. Many of the maps I had experimented with would often boast a very unconventional level design. Despite still following the basic level design such as popular maps like dust2, I had tried different ideas, such as an inverted <a href="https://counterstrike.fandom.com/wiki/Vertigo">'Vertigo'</a> style map where the attacking team started above the defending team. Overall it was a great experience and really what got me into 3d graphics. All the maps i've worked can be downloaded and played/edited <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Hammer_Editor"> here </a> so feel free to mess with them at your leisure.
